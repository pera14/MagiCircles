# MagiCircles
In this Brusspup mind-bender, you may think you see a circle of eight white dots rotating around the inside of a larger red circle, but you’re actually witnessing something else, and you may not believe it unless you see it explained… but then you still might not believe it.                    
This is just a simple of javascript.
You can use this example for free but if you use it for commercial purposes you are obliged to mention author.
